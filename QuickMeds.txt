Good [morning/afternoon], respected faculty members and judges.

We are excited to present our project QuickMeds, a modern pharmacy product management system designed to streamline medicine inventory, simplify pharmacy operations, and enhance customer service.

I’m Het Patel, and I’m joined by my teammates Siddhant Rathod and Rahul Parmar. Together, we’ve built QuickMeds using MERN stack— with a strong focus on performance, usability, and real-world relevance.

The primary goal of QuickMeds is to provide pharmacy owners and staff with an efficient way to manage medicines, track stock levels, and process sales or updates — all through an intuitive web interface.

It addresses common issues like manual errors, expired products, and inventory mismanagement — especially in small or medium-sized pharmacies that cannot afford expensive enterprise tools.

On the backend, we’ve used Node.js with Express to build a RESTful API that handles CRUD operations — for example, adding new medicines, updating stock, deleting products, and retrieving all data.

The database we chose is MongoDB, due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data and easy integration with Node.

On the frontend, we designed a clean and responsive interface that allows users to interact seamlessly with the system, even without technical expertise.

Some key features of QuickMeds include:

    Add / Update / Delete medicines with full validation.

    Search & Filter options for easy product lookup.

    Stock alerts for low-quantity items.

    A dashboard showing key stats like total products, expired items, and stock value.

We’ve also included a dummy data JSON file to quickly populate the database for demo or testing purposes.

During development, we faced several challenges — from ensuring smooth backend-frontend integration to handling MongoDB’s schema-less nature responsibly.

We also learned how important version control is, especially when collaborating. Using Git, we managed to divide tasks, solve merge conflicts, and keep track of progress effectively.

QuickMeds is deployed locally for now and its previous version is hosted on Render, and we’ve structured it in a way that allows easy cloud deployment using platforms like Render, Vercel, or Heroku.

For future versions, we plan to:

    Integrate barcode scanning, Notification handling, ...

In conclusion, QuickMeds is not just a project, but a practical solution built with a real-world mindset. We are proud of what we’ve achieved and grateful for the learning experience this journey provided.

Thank you for your time and attention. We now welcome any questions or feedback you may have.
